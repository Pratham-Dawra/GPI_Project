README - Documentation

To create the SOFI manual as PDF, please go to the build directory and 
type "make doc". This will compile the LaTeX sources into a local PDF 
file in the build directory.

Obviously, LaTeX needs to be installed on your system. Any recent LaTeX
distribution like TeX Live or MiKTeX should work.
